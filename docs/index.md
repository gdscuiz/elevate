# #Elevate

Welcome to the [@GDSCUIZ](https://gdsc.community.dev/university-of-ibn-zohr/) #Elevate.


One of the things that constrain us, all humans, no matter who we are or where we are in, is the limited amount of time per day we have. 

Each one of us has 24 hours. Hence it is one of the most crucial things to optimize our habits and skills if we want to exploit the maximum of it. That helps to dodge unnecessary stressful situations and conflicts while keeping the work/life balance.

By attending this series of events, you got the chance to #Elevate your skillset and learn some of the skills needed to enhance your productivity.

You will also get the chance to learn how you build your branding to improve your visibility and get noticed in the job market.

The first phase, #Think, will concentrate on the skills needed to turn our ideas into actionable projects.

And during the #Manage phase, we will be covering the most needed knowledge needed to manage your projects effectively.

Then we will see the techniques used to #Communicate your ideas and solutions. As well as learn how to create a personal brand for yourself to gain visibility in the job market.

Then for the #Apply sessions, we will get the chance to learn the tools needed to apply all the things we saw.

Then as part of the #Innovate phase, you will have the chance to participate in @GDSCUIZ Ideathon, where you will apply all the knowledge you learned to create a clear plan for your solution and start preparing for the solution challenge.




At the end of these sessions, during the #Innovate phase you will have the chance to participate in @GDSCUIZ Ideathon, where you will apply all the knowledge you learned to create a clear plan for your solution and start preparing for the solution challenge.
